When using JavaScript, you have to use queryselector to connect any input from HTML elements to the script.
Whereas with Vue, you can create reactive data and connect by using v-model.
The reactive data will be automatically updated as the changes are made, instead of having to reset them manually.

Comparing it to the Student Club Roster example, both solutions look pretty similar to me since it is a pretty small project.
However, I would prefer to use Vue for larger and more complex projects, especially with the component structure that Vue supports.
Also, the code structure of Vue is easier to read since you can check the list of return properties and functions in one place.
